# Enables Delphi's auto updater
#
# The auto update is checked each time the plugin starts. If a new version is found, it's
# automatically downloaded and when the server is restarted, the new version is applied
# using the 'update' folder in the 'plugins' folder.
#
# If this is disabled, only a notice message will be displayed when a new version is
# available
